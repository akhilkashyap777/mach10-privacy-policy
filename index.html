    <h1>Privacy Policy for Mach-10</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 16, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 16, 2025</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>No Data Collection Statement</h2>
        <p><strong>Mach-10 does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data or information from users.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h2>How Mach-10 Works</h2>
    <p>Mach-10 is a local file sharing application that enables users to share files between devices on their local network. The application operates entirely within your local network environment and does not require an internet connection to function.</p>

    <h2>What Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal information (names, email addresses, phone numbers)</li>
        <li>File contents or file names</li>
        <li>Device information or identifiers</li>
        <li>Usage statistics or analytics</li>
        <li>IP addresses or network information</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Any other personal or technical data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Network Operation</h2>
    <p>All file transfers performed by Mach-10 occur directly between your devices on your local network. No data is sent to external servers, cloud services, or third parties. The application does not connect to the internet for any data collection or transmission purposes.</p>

    <h2>No Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Mach-10 does not integrate with or use any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The application operates as a standalone tool without external dependencies for data processing.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since Mach-10 does not collect or store any data, there are no data security concerns related to personal information. All file transfers remain within your local network and under your direct control.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Mach-10 does not collect any information from users of any age, including children under 13. The application can be safely used by users of all ages without privacy concerns.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our application or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted at this location with an updated "Last Updated" date. Since the application does not collect data, changes will typically be minor clarifications or legal updates.</p>

    <h2>Microsoft Store Compliance</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy is provided to comply with Microsoft Store requirements. Mach-10's privacy-first design ensures user data protection by not collecting any data in the first place.</p>
