    <h1>Privacy Policy for Mach-10</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 27, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 27, 2025</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Data Collection Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>Mach-10 collects limited analytics data through Google Analytics to improve the application experience. We do NOT collect or store your personal files or file contents.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h2>How Mach-10 Works</h2>
    <p>Mach-10 is a local file sharing application that enables users to share files between devices on their local network. The core file sharing functionality operates entirely within your local network environment and does not require an internet connection. However, the application does collect anonymous usage analytics when an internet connection is available.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>Analytics Data (via Google Analytics)</h3>
    <p>We use Google Analytics 4 to collect anonymous usage information to help us improve the application. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>App usage statistics (features used, session duration)</li>
        <li>Device and browser information (OS version, browser type, screen resolution)</li>
        <li>General location data (country/region level only, not precise location)</li>
        <li>Technical performance data</li>
        <li>Anonymous user identifiers</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="important">
        <h3>What We Do NOT Collect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal information (names, email addresses, phone numbers)</li>
            <li><strong>File contents or file names that you share</strong></li>
            <li>Precise location data</li>
            <li>Personal identifiable information</li>
            <li>Login credentials or passwords</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Local Network File Sharing</h2>
    <p>All file transfers performed by Mach-10 occur directly between your devices on your local network. <strong>No file contents or file names are sent to external servers, cloud services, or third parties.</strong> Only anonymous usage analytics are transmitted to Google Analytics.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    
    <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
    <p>We use Google Analytics 4 (Property ID: G-GB13XFSKWC) to collect and analyze usage data. This service is provided by Google LLC and is subject to Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>
    
    <p>Google Analytics may use cookies and similar tracking technologies. You can learn more about how Google uses data from our app at: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a></p>

    <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>Google Analytics may store cookies and use local storage on your device to track usage patterns. These are used solely for analytics purposes and do not contain personal information about your files or activities.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices and Opt-Out Options</h2>
    <p>You can opt out of Google Analytics tracking by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a></li>
        <li>Disabling cookies in your browser settings</li>
        <li>Using the app offline (analytics only work when connected to the internet)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>The analytics data collected is processed by Google Analytics using industry-standard security measures. Your file sharing activities remain completely local and private. We do not have direct access to individual user data collected by Google Analytics.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Google Analytics retains data according to their standard retention policies. We have configured our Analytics settings to automatically delete user and event data after 14 months. You can request deletion of your data by contacting us.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Mach-10 does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The analytics data we collect is anonymous and not linked to personal identities. Parents can disable analytics tracking using the opt-out methods mentioned above.</p>

    <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Analytics data may be transferred to and processed in countries outside your residence, including the United States, where Google Analytics servers are located. This transfer is necessary for the service functionality.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our application, legal requirements, or privacy practices. Any changes will be posted at this location with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

    <h2>Microsoft Store Compliance</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy complies with Microsoft Store requirements regarding data collection and user privacy. The analytics collection is limited to improving user experience and does not compromise the core privacy-focused design of the file sharing functionality.</p>
